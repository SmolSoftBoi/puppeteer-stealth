## Ethical Automation & Transparency

- [ ] CHK001 README and sample code include the compliance disclaimer and respectful automation guidance (rate limits, robots.txt acknowledgement).
- [ ] CHK002 Feature does not describe or enable bypassing authentication, paywalls, or other security controls.
- [ ] CHK003 Defaults keep automation conservative and require explicit opt-in for risky behavior.

## Modular Implementation & Documentation

- [ ] CHK005 All exported APIs have updated TSDoc plus runnable examples showing safe defaults.
- [ ] CHK006 Changelog entry and bundle-size delta are recorded for this change.

## Testing & Release Discipline

- [ ] CHK007 Unit tests cover critical paths and edge cases.
- [ ] CHK008 Local Puppeteer fixture integration tests validate the module without hitting third-party sites.
- [ ] CHK009 Debug hooks/logging demonstrate how adopters can audit which evasions are active.
